OOPS
main pillars of OOPS are:-
class,object,inheritance,polymorphism,encapsulation,abstraction
class:- class is a blueprint of object
object:- object is a instance of class
instance:- it means memory allocation 
object can be specified in 2 ways:- 1. Identifiable characteristic 2.using behaviour 
polymorphism:-1*many forms is known as polymorphism 
it is classified in 2 types:- 1.Methodoverloading 2.Methodoverriding
encapsulation:-binding of data and method into single unit is known as encapsulation , we provide security by using accessing modifiers 
1. public 2. protected(_) 3. private (__)
data mangling:- to access the private properties we use the concept of data mangling 
syntax to access private properties:- object._className__Methodname
